### What is a Design Sprint?

The Design Sprint is a 4-day process meant to help teams solve big challenges, validate new ideas and improve existing products very quickly and efficiently. The original Design Sprint was born at Google Ventures with the purpose of helping their teams innovate faster and better. We're working with the updated 4 day version.

The Sprint consists of a set of very specific exercises that help teams get alignment around a challenge and fosters a collaborative and creative problem solving setup. The whole idea of the Sprint is to help us flex that creative muscle, decide on a solution we want to validate and test it out with real users in just a few days of work. Sounds awesome, right? 

Watch an overview of the original process here:

### The guiding principles

- **Getting started is more important than being 100% right.** The Sprint is here to help us adopt a versatile think-prototype-test-learn mindset. This allows us to be agile problem solvers and make better decisions faster.
- **Learning in the real world consolidates desk research.** A la the Lean Startup approach, we want to validate our ideas with real people really fast.
- **Tangible results are better than endless discussions.** You'll see the Sprint is really intense and there are no empty conversations. Every time we will talk, comment or discuss, we'll be looking AT something (a sketch, a prototype, an example).
- **You don't need to be an artist.** Although it's called a **Design** Sprint, you don't need to be an interface design expert. The process allows anyone with any role to come up with great ideas.

### The task

As part of our preparation efforts, everyone in the team has been interviewed and we formulated our problem statement, along with ideas belonging to the problem space. 

**"How Might We service that provides external revenue without affecting our members services and that effectively addresses the needs of its users."**

**This is what we uncovered:**

- Finding #1 with explanations, ie. "We noticed our customers our leaving our product really quickly after signing up"
- Finding #2 with explanations,  ie. "Research shows people don't understand what we do and how we're different"
- Finding #3 with explanations
- Finding #4 with explanations
- Finding #5 with explanations

### The expectations

By the end of our Design Sprint, we expect the following outcomes: 

- Have a better, more complete understanding of the challenges we face when it comes to [Harvesting Service]
- Have generated a set of potential solutions to improve the experience
- Have created a customer-facing, low-fidelity prototype
- Have tested out the prototype with 5 real customers & collected feedback
- Have a clear answer whether our solutions is viable + next steps

### When?

The Design Sprint schedule looks like this:

The Core Sprint team will be engaged in Day 1 and Day 2. The Product designer will take over on Day 3 and finally, the Focus Group team will conclude on Day 4. Everyone should have received the appropriate calendar invites. If you do not see them, please reach out immediately.

You have all been invited to join the [Metadata Harvesting Services](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/yv1IhuKuMgla24PKV3G3kmhzK3Stf7Yww8nnHlDHwKfOcLmLq5p5VVa9PEns7Uoj) Remote Design Sprint Miro board. If you haven't received the invite, please reach out immediately.
