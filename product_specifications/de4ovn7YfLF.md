## Problem/Idea

There’s growing interest in finding good ways to report on scholars’ openness. 

We can show the distribution of the data of licenses of the DOIs but that just showing raw data. It is not coveying any information to the Commons visitor. 

Problem/Idea validation: [](https://jlsc-pub.org/articles/abstract/10.7710/2162-3309.1025/)

## Solution 

Create an Open Access Badge, similar to that of ImpactStory, that [transform](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/difference-data-information-intelligence/) the `data` into useful `information` to the Commons visitor.

Solution validation: [This approach has been pioneered in other researcher profiles such as ImpactStory](https://blog.ourresearch.org/what-level-of-open-access-scholar-are-you/)
