        Scenario: The user is not a client-admin
            Given that the user is not a client-admin
             When when the user land in any tab of Fabrica

            Given the user has used correct credentials
             When the user has logged in

             When the he user is entering data in the Format input
             Then the input field should suggest format based on the inputed data
              And the suggested values should be based on the IANA media types https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
              and the Format input help test should read: "The default format scheme is provided by the IANA Media Types. https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml"

        Scenario: Selecting Format using auto suggest
            Given that the user is in the DOI form
              And the user entered some value in the Format input field
             When the user selected one of the suggested values
             Then the FORMAT input field should be filled with the "Name" value from the IANA media types
              And the FORMAT value to be sent should be the "Template" value from the IANA media types

        Scenario: Ignoring Format auto suggest

## Non Functional Requirements

- [ ] As a product designer, I would like the following html element to have a ID so that we can track selection in our analytics platform.
 - In the "create new DOI" button



## Feature Flag

This feature is implemented behind `fabrica-2022` feature flag and disabled by default.
Once we've confirmed the feature is deemed stable, we remove the feature flag in order to publish the feature as GA.
