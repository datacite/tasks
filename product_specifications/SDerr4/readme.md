##Â Public REST Versioning Strategy 

## Problem

Our API is getting versionied but we dont know expose/follow a clear strategy of how we do versioning.

## Solution 

Display a list of the top five co-authors of a particular researcher.

- REST Version 3



 [API Versioning at DataCite Documentation](/support_doc.md)

 Solution Validation: We run a feedback session with a number REST API users and gather their feedback.
