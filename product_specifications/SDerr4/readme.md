##Â Public REST Versioning Strategy 

## Problem

Our API is getting versionied but we dont know expose/follow a clear strategy of how we do versioning.

## Solution 

Display a list of the top five co-authors of a particular researcher.


 [API Versioning at DataCite Documentation](/support_doc.md)

 Solution Validation: We run a feedback session with a number REST API users and gather their feedback.



As up today that would be:

Relese Candiate
- https://api.datacite.org paths:
  - /v3/dois
  - /v3/repositories
  - /v3/organisations

For Deprecation
- https://ez.datacite.org, all paths 
- https://api.datacite.org, paths:
  - /works
  - /clients
  - /users
