## Problem

A new version of the metadata schema has been released, and we need users to have access to it via our systems.

Problem Validation: [The metadata WG has already worked on validating the changes of the Schema](https://wiki.tib.eu/confluence/display/datacite/Agenda)

## Proposed Solution 

Modify our services to handle schema version 4.4

Solution Validation: [We have performed all minor changes activities in the past](https://github.com/datacite/schema/issues/56)
