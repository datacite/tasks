## This is not a Static Development Journey

Think about it as a Product. We release an MVP and then we iterate to improve it.


- Q1. Work in the implementation (Document, templates, productboard changes,communicate to internal stakeholders, etc.)
- Q2. MVP Run (two sprints)
  - Expect mistakes, problems, missing thing... learning.
- Q3. Proper First Run
  - Run a retrospective at the end of quarter.
- Q4. Implemente feedback from retrospective.



## Objectives

#### From HWMs

- HWM have complete and timely product specifications
- HMW improve suggestion changes coordination with the metadata WG
- HMW has a seamless handover with precise product specification
- HMW better incorporate member input?
- HMW deals with resourcing for the activities in this part of the cycle.
- HMW successfully coordinate between teams
- HMW come to a collective agreement on our priorities


#### From Affinity Mapping

- Process all insights in ProductBoard
- Collect Solution Validation Data
- Prioritisation in the RoadMap meeting
- Plan broader Communication
- Collect further input from the community/stakeholders
- Reviewed feature Technical feasibility
- Describe what will not be done (or later) and why

## HWMs


### HWM have complete and timely product specifications

- Having a checklist of items to include in the spec.
- Working in parallel tracks with the development team.

### HMW improve suggestion changes coordination with the metadata WG

- Coordinate a campaign of validation for a suggestion that reaches datacite first.
- Hand over the suggestion and validation results to Metadata WG via the appropriate channels.
- Publish the metadata WG decision Process in the support website.

### HMW has a seamless handover with clear product specification

- Use a Build/Delivery Backlog meeting every half a sprint to groom use stories in the specification.
- Use a Sprint Planning meeting before every Sprint to schedule which user stories from the product specification will be built in the Sprint.
- Asynchronously openly review product specifications and its user stories during the Sprint.
- Unify Product Specification as much as possible in a single document. 
- Use the Roadmap meeting to communicate and decide prioritisation of solutions.

### HMW better incorporate member input?

- Use an Idea/Problem/Suggestion Validation cycle for member input using multiple venues and methods.
- Use a  Validation cycle for grant requirements.
- Publish request from input in the roadmap.

### HMW deals with resourcing for the activities in this part of the cycle.

- Having flexibility on the methods used in new activities (such as validations)
- Using open asynchronous review to manage specifications.


### HMW successfully coordinate between teams

- Communicate to DataCite Staff the status of Idea/Problem/Suggestion/Solution at different Journey stages.
- Encourage directors to pass the common understanding down to their teams.
- Work in a parallel track for discovering and building solutions with the Tech Team.
- Use the srpint meeting to schedule work clearly


### HMW come to a collective agreement on our priorities

- De/Prioritize, both validated Problems/Suggestion and validated Solutions only in the Roadmap Action call.
- Involve the technical team and the engagement team at the early stages of the Development Journey.



## To integrate with future iterations.

- To be more involved in the Metadata schema design changes.
- To communicate early in the process with Members about the ideas/suggestions/request they have provided.
-
